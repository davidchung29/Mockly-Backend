# Mockly Backend

This repository previously contained the backend code for **Mockly**, including our AI analysis pipeline, real-time scoring engine, and report generation service for behavioral interview practice.

To protect proprietary infrastructure and models, the backend code is now private.

ðŸ“¬ For recruiters or collaborators interested in seeing the implementation, contact **dichung@andrew.cmu.edu** and I can provide access upon request.
